# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Classification-using-Exaplainable-AI

🧠 Brain Tumor MRI Classification using CNN + Explainable AI (Grad-CAM & Integrated Gradients)

This project uses Deep Learning and Explainable AI (XAI) to classify brain MRI images into:

Glioma

Meningioma

Pituitary Tumor

Healthy Brain

It also generates heatmaps using Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients to show why the model made a prediction.

🚀 Features

CNN-based tumor classification

Explainability using Grad-CAM

Pixel-level explanations using Integrated Gradients

Preprocessing: normalization, resizing, augmentation

Model evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC

Heatmap visualization

Easy to extend to 3D MRI scans
